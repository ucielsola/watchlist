# WatchList 🍿

Welcome to my first React Project! I´m working on this project to gain more knowledge and practice my React skills.
This is v3.0.0, and has very few commits and comments. You can find older versions (not production-cured like this) in their respective repos:
- [WatchList-v1](https://github.com/ucielsola/WatchList-old)
- [WatchList-v2](https://github.com/ucielsola/watchlist-v2-old)

With WachList you will create a list of Movies and TV Shows you want to watch, or have watched. The search functionality is built using the great API from [TheMovieDB](https://themoviedb.org).
